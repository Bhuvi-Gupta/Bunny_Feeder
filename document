To overcome that, we will use the windowWidth and windowHeight variables instead of having a fixed screen size. This will automatically change the screen 
size based on the size of the screen of the user. But here is the problem, this will only work for a computer screen. This won't work with the mobile 
screen. For mobile screens, we need to use displayWidth and displayHeight, and we are going to use both of these. We will create a variable var isMobile, 
which will store the type of mobile such as iphone, ipad or android. Then we will write a condition that will check the device we are currently on, if we 
are on a mobile device it will use diplayWidth and displayHeight, if we are on a computer screen it will use windowWidth and windowHeight. Now, create two 
variables as var canW and canH, these will store the width and height of the screen. 
Note: We are adding 80 to the displayWidth in order to properly fit the screen width. As in some devices, game width is lesser than the screen width. If 
you feel the game is stretched too much in the mobile, you can remove the 80 or reduce the value to an appropriate number.
This will create a dynamic screen size. But it will not work. Because we need to add a very important line of code in our HTML file that will make the 
webpage screen responsive.
<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=0.825,minimum-scale=0.8,width=device-width">
This line will make sure that our game will adapt to any screen size. This will set the game width and height according to the screen size of the device 
Now, we need to change a few more things, such as the position of the bunny and the ground. The current position we set for the bunny and ground is by 
assuming a screen size of 500 x 700, but since we made it screen adaptive, it will place the bunny and the ground at different locations which may not 
be desirable to us.
Here we are placing the ground and bunny with respect to the new screen size. So the ground y-position will be canH which is the height of the screen. 
And the y-position of the bunny will be canH-80. So the bunny will be placed on the ground. One more important change we need to make in the background 
image, the background image is placed at 0,0 which is the top left corner of the canvas. But the image size will be fixed as 500 x 700px. This will not 
cover our entire screen if the screen size is bigger. But we can specify the image size as well, and here we will do that using displayWidth and 
displayHeight. We will also add some value in displayWidth to make sure the image covers the entire screen size.
